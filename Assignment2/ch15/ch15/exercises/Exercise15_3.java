/*
Rewrite the Rectangle class to extend the GeometricObject class and implement the Comparable 
interface. Override the equals() method such that two rectangle objects are equal if their areas are the 
same. Note that you need override method CompareTo() to work for rectangle objects. Write a test 
program to create two rectangle objects and then call methods equals() and CompareTo() on these 
objects.
