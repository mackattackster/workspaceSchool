//Write a Java program that repeatedly prompt the user to enter a capital for a state. Upon receiving the 
//user input, the program reports whether the answer is correct. If incorrect, the program displays the 
//correct answer. Assume that 50 states and their capitals are stored in a two-dimensional array (2 
//columns and 50 rows). The program generates the questions randomly. The program must use a list 
//(generated from the array using the syntax Arrays.asList(arrayName) and then shuffle the list. 
//The program then generates the questions. Keep track of correct and incorrect answers, allow the user 
//to quit at anytime and at such time, and at then display number of correct and incorrect answers
