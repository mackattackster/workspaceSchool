Modify the GeometricObject class to implement the Comparable interface, and define a static max 
method in the GeometricObject class for finding the larger of two GeometricObject objects. Implement 
the new GeometricObject class. Write a test program that uses the max method to find the largest of two 
circles and the larger of two rectangles
